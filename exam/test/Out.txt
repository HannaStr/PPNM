Compare the results for the algorith with division into 2 and 3 subintervals respectively.
Calculation for function f(x)=x^2 (expected value 1/3)
Approximate integral (check 2): 0.333333333333333
Approximate integral (sub2): 0.333333333333333

Testing the implementation of the integration algorithm (2 subintervals).
The result is compared to the expected values with uncertainty 10e-4.
1)
Integral of [Sqrt(x)] in respect of x with limit (0,1) is: 0.666680932893738.

It should be 2/3.
In this case this is: 
True
1.42662270710137E-05
2)
Integral of [1/Sqrt(x)] in respect of x with limit (0,1) is: 1.99999738796403.
